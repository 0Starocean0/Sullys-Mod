## Contributing to Sully's Mod

First of all we want to thank you for contributing! ðŸŽ‰

Now before you start, we want to mention a few things that you should be aware of before contributing to this project.

**1.** When contributing a data file, like a translation, tag, recipe etc, </br>
please make sure your file is **not** under `src/generated/resources/...` but under `src/main/resources/...`

**2.** When creating a code contribution please make sure to adopt our naming conventions and our code structure!
- You are **not** allowed to change anything about the current project structure without our permission
- You are allowed to contribute new ideas that were not planned before, but of course we will only merge it if we like the idea and think it fits the theme of the mod

### [These contribution guidlines will likely be extended in the future]
